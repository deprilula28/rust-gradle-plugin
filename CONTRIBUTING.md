## How to contribute
I didn't actually know what a pull request was until this commit, but if you want to contribute I'm okay with it.

The main points are:
* Pull requests should always go to `wip`.
* Make sure you have unit tests when possible (under `src/test/groovy/com/jtitor/gradle/`).
* **All commits are under MIT license.**
